        train n_fold * n_preset models) or just with a simple random hold-out set.

        The data is first fitted on several well working MODNet presets
        with a validation set (10% of the furnished data by default).

        Sets the `self.model` attribute to the model with the lowest mean validation loss across
        all folds.

            val_fraction: The fraction of the data to use for validation.
            classification: Whether or not we are performing classification.
            refit: Whether or not to refit the final model for each fold with
                the best-performing settings.
            fast: Used for debugging. If `True`, only fit the first 2 presets and
                reduce the number of epochs.
            nested: integer specifying whether or not to perform a full nested CV. If 0,
                a simple validation split is performed based on val_fraction argument.
                If an integer, use this number of inner CV folds, ignoring the `val_fraction` argument.
                Note: If set to 1, the value will be overwritten to a default of 5 folds.
